COMMUNICATION
In engineering, communication plays a vital role in conveying
technical information, ideas, and project requirements. Engineers
need to communicate effectively with team members, clients, and
stakeholders. This involves using precise technical language,
diagrams, and documentation to convey complex concepts. Clear
communication is crucial for project planning, problem-solving, and
ensuring everyone involved understands the goals and specifications.
Whether through technical reports, design documentation, or
meetings, effective communication enhances collaboration and
contributes to the success of engineering projects.
The effectiveness of data communication system depends on Four
Fundamental characteristics delivery, accuracy, timeliness and jitter.
1.Delivery:- The system must deliver the data accurately. Data must
be received by the intended device or user and only by that device or
user.
2.Accuracy:- The system must deliver the data accurately. Data that
have been altered in transmission and left uncorrected are unusable.
3.Timeliness:- The system must deliver the data in timely manner.
Data delivered late is useless. In the case of video and audio, timely
delivering data as they are produced, in the same order that they are
produced and without significant delay.
4.Jitter:- It refers to the variation in the packet arrival time. It is the
uneven delay in the audio delivery ,video packets delivery.
ONGC uses both wired and wireless communication systems. For nonwired
communication, ONGC uses radio and satellite communication.
For wired communication it uses the links of VSAT. Wired
communication is done by the help of lease line, fibre optic cable,
coaxial cable etc. ONGC also uses the SCADA platform for supervising
the activities which are being going on in the offshore as well as
onshore rigs and platforms to monitor the multiple sites and is
responsible for the collection of data to a single location.
NETWORK
Computer networks are a fundamental part of modern computing and
communication systems. A computer network is a collection of
interconnected devices and systems that can communicate with each other
and share resources. Here are some key details about computer networks:
1. Definition:-
 A computer network is a set of interconnected computers and
other devices that can communicate with each other to share
information and resources.
2. Components:-
 Nodes: Devices such as computers, printers, routers, and
servers that are part of the network.
 Links: The physical or wireless connections that enable
communication between nodes.
3. Types of Networks:-
 LAN (Local Area Network): A network that covers a small
geographical area, like a single building or a campus.
 WAN (Wide Area Network): A network that spans a larger
geographical area, often connecting LANs in different locations.
 MAN (Metropolitan Area Network): A network that covers a
city or a large campus.
4. Network Topologies:-

networks form the backbone of communication and information exchange
in today's interconnected world.
LOCAL AREA NETWORK(LAN)
A Local Area Network (LAN) is a type of computer network that covers a relatively
small geographic area, typically confined to a single building or a campus. LANs
allow connected devices to share resources, such as files, printers, and internet
access. Here are some key characteristics of LANs:
1. Geographical Scope:
 LANs cover a limited geographic area, usually within the range of a
single building, a set of neighboring buildings, or a campus.
2. High Data Transfer Rates:
 LANs often provide high data transfer rates, allowing for fast
communication between devices. This is crucial for applications that
require real-time or near-real-time data exchange.
3. Private Ownership:
 LANs are typically owned, set up, and maintained by a single
organization, such as a company, school, or government agency. This
contrasts with Wide Area Networks (WANs), which may involve multiple
organizations and cover larger geographical areas.
4. Connectivity:
 Devices in a LAN are connected through various technologies,
including Ethernet cables, Wi-Fi, or a combination of both. Ethernet is a
common wired technology for LANs, while Wi-Fi is widely used for
wireless connectivity.
Fig : Local Area Network
WIDE AREA NETWORK(WAN)
A Wide Area Network (WAN) is a type of computer network that spans a large
geographic area, connecting multiple Local Area Networks (LANs) or other types of
networks. Unlike LANs, which are typically confined to a single building or campus,
WANs cover broader regions and often involve the use of public or private
telecommunication infrastructure. Here are some key characteristics of WANs:
1. Geographical Scope:
 WANs cover a large geographic area, such as a city, country, or even
spanning across continents. They are designed to facilitate
communication over long distances.
2. Public and Private Infrastructure:
 WANs can use a combination of public and private telecommunication
services and infrastructure. This may include leased lines, satellite links,
fiber-optic cables, and other communication technologies.
3. Low Data Transfer Rates Compared to LANs:
 While WANs enable communication over long distances, they generally
offer lower data transfer rates compared to LANs. This limitation is
often a result of the increased latency and potential bandwidth
constraints associated with long-distance communication.
4. Interconnected LANs:
 WANs connect multiple LANs or other types of networks, allowing
seamless communication and resource sharing among devices across
different locations. This interconnected nature facilitates collaboration
in organizations with geographically dispersed offices.
5. Private or Public Ownership:
 WANs may be owned and operated by private enterprises, government
agencies, or telecommunication service providers. The internet itself
can be considered a global WAN, connecting countless private and
public networks.
METROPOLITAN AREA NETWORK(MAN)
A Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) is a type of computer network that spans a
larger geographic area than a Local Area Network (LAN) but is smaller than a Wide
Area Network (WAN). MANs typically cover a city or a large campus, connecting
multiple LANs within that specific metropolitan area. Here are some key
characteristics of MANs:
1. Geographical Scope:
 MANs cover a larger geographic area compared to LANs but are
smaller than WANs. They typically span a city or a large campus,
connecting various locations within that metropolitan area.
2. High-Speed Connectivity:
 MANs provide high-speed connectivity, allowing for efficient
communication and data transfer between connected LANs. This is
essential for applications that require substantial bandwidth and low
latency within the metropolitan area.
3. Interconnecting LANs:
 The primary purpose of a MAN is to interconnect multiple LANs,
enabling seamless communication and resource sharing between
different locations within the defined metropolitan area.
4. Public or Private Ownership:
 MANs can be owned and operated by private enterprises, local
governments, or telecommunication service providers. In some cases,
MAN infrastructure may be a collaboration between multiple entities.
5. Fiber Optic and Wireless Technologies:
 MANs often make use of advanced communication technologies,
including fiber-optic cables and wireless connections, to ensure highspeed
and reliable connectivity within the metropolitan area.
NETWORK TOPOLOGIES
Network topology refers to the physical or logical layout of the nodes
(devices such as computers, printers, and servers) and the connections
between them in a computer network. Different topologies have distinct
advantages and disadvantages in terms of cost, scalability, reliability, and
ease of maintenance. Here are some common network topologies:
1. Bus Topology:
 In a bus topology, all nodes are connected to a single central
cable called a "bus" or "backbone." Data is transmitted along
the bus, and each node receives the data, but only the intended
recipient processes it. While it is simple and inexpensive, a
failure in the central cable can disrupt the entire network.
2. Ring Topology:
 In a ring topology, each node is connected to exactly two other
nodes, forming a closed loop or ring. Data circulates around
the ring until it reaches the intended recipient. While it is
orderly and predictable, a failure in one node or cable can
disrupt the entire network.
3. Star Topology:
 In a star topology, all nodes are connected to a central hub or
switch. Data is transmitted through the hub, and the hub
directs the data to the appropriate node. If a node or cable
fails, it does not affect the rest of the network. However, the
central hub becomes a single point of failure.
4. Mesh Topology:
 In a mesh topology, every node is connected to every other
node in the network. This provides redundancy, as there are
multiple paths for data transmission. Mesh topologies can be
categorized into full mesh (every node connected to every
other node) or partial mesh (only some nodes have direct
connections). While highly reliable, mesh topologies can be
expensive and complex to set up.
The choice of network topology depends on factors such as the
organization's size, budget, scalability requirements, and the level of
redundancy and fault tolerance needed. Each topology has its strengths
and weaknesses, and the selection is based on the specific needs and
constraints of the network environment.
OSI MODEL
The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model is a conceptual framework
that standardizes the functions of a telecommunication or computing
system into seven abstraction layers. The model was developed by the
International Organization for Standardization (ISO) to facilitate the
understanding and design of network protocols and communication
processes. Each layer of the OSI model performs specific functions, and
communication between devices is achieved by passing data through these
layers. Here's an overview of the seven layers of the OSI model:
1. Physical Layer (Layer 1):
 The Physical Layer deals with the physical connection between
devices. It defines the hardware elements of the network, such
as cables, connectors, switches, and the transmission of raw
binary data (bits) over the physical medium. It is concerned
with the electrical and mechanical characteristics of the
transmission media.
2. Data Link Layer (Layer 2):
 The Data Link Layer is responsible for the reliable transfer of
data between directly connected nodes. It frames the raw bits
into frames and provides error detection and correction
mechanisms. This layer ensures the integrity of data
transmission within the same local network segment and deals
with the Media Access Control (MAC) address.
3. Network Layer (Layer 3):
 The Network Layer is responsible for routing and forwarding
data between different networks. It deals with logical
addressing (such as IP addresses), packet forwarding, and
routing. The primary function is to determine the optimal path
for data to travel from the source to the destination across
multiple networks.
4. Transport Layer (Layer 4):
 The Transport Layer manages end-to-end communication
between devices across a network. It is responsible for ensuring
that data is delivered reliably and error-free. This layer uses
protocols like Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) for reliable
and connection-oriented communication, or User Datagram
Protocol (UDP) for connectionless communication.
5. Session Layer (Layer 5):
 The Session Layer establishes, maintains, and terminates
sessions or connections between applications on different
devices. It manages dialog control, allowing multiple
applications to communicate and synchronize their data
exchange.
6. Presentation Layer (Layer 6):
 The Presentation Layer is responsible for data translation,
encryption, and compression to ensure that the data sent by
the application layer of one system can be properly interpreted
by the application layer of another system. It deals with the
format and syntax of data, translating between different data
formats and character sets.
7. Application Layer (Layer 7):
 The Application Layer is the topmost layer and interacts directly
with end-user applications. It provides network services directly
to end-users or application processes. Examples of application
layer protocols include HTTP (Hypertext Transfer
Protocol).SMTP and FTP.
The OSI model is a reference framework that helps in understanding the
functionalities and interactions of different networking protocols. It assists
in the development and troubleshooting of network systems by providing a
structured way to conceptualize the complex processes involved in
communication between devices on a network. While it's a conceptual
model, the OSI model is not a strict standard, and actual network protocols
like TCP/IP often don't strictly adhere to its seven-layer structure.
TCP/IP MODEL
The TCP/IP model, also known as the Internet protocol suite, is a conceptual
framework used for designing and implementing network protocols. It is the
foundation of the Internet and is named after two of its most important protocols:
the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the Internet Protocol (IP). The TCP/IP
model consists of four abstraction layers, each with its own set of protocols, and it is
more widely used in practice than the seven-layer OSI model. Here's an overview of
the four layers of the TCP/IP model:
1. Link Layer (or Network Interface Layer):
 The Link Layer is the lowest layer in the TCP/IP model and is equivalent
to the combination of the Physical Layer and Data Link Layer in the OSI
model. It deals with the physical connection between devices and the
protocols needed for the local network to transmit frames. This layer
includes technologies such as Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and PPP (Point-to-Point
Protocol).
2. Internet Layer:
 The Internet Layer is equivalent to the Network Layer in the OSI model.
It is responsible for addressing, routing, and fragmenting and
reassembling data packets. The Internet Protocol (IP), both IPv4 and
IPv6, is the primary protocol at this layer. Other protocols, such as ICMP
(Internet Control Message Protocol), are also part of the Internet Layer.
3. Transport Layer:
 The Transport Layer corresponds to the Transport Layer in the OSI
model. Its main function is to provide end-to-end communication
between devices on different networks. The two primary transport layer
protocols are:
 Transmission Control Protocol (TCP): Offers reliable,
connection-oriented communication with features like error
checking, flow control, and congestion control.
 User Datagram Protocol (UDP): Provides connectionless
communication with minimal overhead, suitable for applications
where speed is more critical than reliability.
4. Application Layer:
 The Application Layer is equivalent to the combined Session,
Presentation, and Application Layers in the OSI model. It is the top layer
of the TCP/IP model and interacts directly with end-user applications.
Numerous application layer protocols exist, and some of the most
common include:
 Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP): Used for web browsing.
 File Transfer Protocol (FTP): Used for file transfers.
 Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP): Used for sending
emails.
 Post Office Protocol version 3 (POP3) and Internet Message
Access Protocol (IMAP): Used for receiving emails.
 Domain Name System (DNS): Resolves domain names to IP
addresses.
The TCP/IP model is more practical for describing and understanding the architecture
of the Internet and is widely used in networking implementations. It serves as the
basis for the protocols that enable communication and data exchange over the
Internet. While the TCP/IP model has four layers, its functionalities align closely with
the OSI model's seven layers.
IEEE 802.3(ETHERNET).
IEEE 802.3 is a set of standards defining the physical layer and the data link layer of the OSI model
for wired Ethernet networks. Ethernet is one of the most widely used networking technologies,
providing a framework for organizing, addressing, and transmitting data packets between devices
within a local area network (LAN). The IEEE 802.3 standard specifies the details of the Ethernet
protocol. Here are key aspects of IEEE 802.3, commonly referred to as Ethernet:
IPv4 and IPv6
IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4) and IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6) are two versions of
the Internet Protocol, the set of rules governing the format of data packets and the
addressing scheme used for devices on the Internet. Both versions play a crucial role in
facilitating communication between devices over networks, but IPv6 was introduced to
address the limitations of IPv4.
IPv6, or Internet Protocol version 6, is the most recent version of the Internet Protocol,
designed to succeed IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4). IPv6 was introduced to address the
limitations of IPv4, particularly its limited address space. The primary motivation behind IPv6
is to provide a larger pool of unique IP addresses to accommodate the growing number of
devices connected to the internet.
TCP AND UDP
TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) are two of the most
widely used transport layer protocols in computer networks. They provide the means for
communication between applications on different devices by establishing a logical
connection for data exchange.
UDP, or User Datagram Protocol, is one of the core transport layer protocols in the Internet
Protocol (IP) suite. It provides a connectionless, lightweight communication mechanism
between devices on a network. Unlike TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), UDP does not
establish a dedicated connection before transmitting data and does not ensure reliable,
ordered delivery of packets. UDP is often chosen for scenarios where low latency and quick
data transmission are more critical than guaranteed delivery.
VSAT
VSAT stands for Very Small Aperture Terminal. It is a type of satellite communication
technology that enables two-way communication between a central hub (typically
called the "teleport") and remote satellite terminals, often referred to as VSAT
terminals or stations. VSAT systems are commonly used for various applications,
including internet connectivity, private data networks, and voice communication in
remote or rural areas. Here are the key characteristics of VSAT systems:
1. Satellite Communication:
 VSAT systems use geostationary satellites to facilitate communication
between the central hub and remote VSAT terminals. The satellites are
positioned in orbit, allowing for continuous communication coverage
over a specific geographic area.
2. Two-Way Communication:
 VSAT systems support bidirectional communication, enabling data
transmission in both upstream (from remote terminals to the central
hub) and downstream (from the central hub to remote terminals)
directions. This makes VSAT suitable for applications like internet
access, video conferencing, and corporate networking.
3. Small Aperture Terminals:
 The VSAT terminals have small-sized antennas (apertures), typically
ranging from 75 centimeters to a few meters in diameter. The smaller
size of the antennas makes VSAT systems more suitable for installations
in various locations, including remote sites, maritime vessels, and small
businesses.
4. Hub-and-Spoke Topology:
 VSAT networks often have a hub-and-spoke topology, where a central
hub or teleport communicates with multiple remote VSAT terminals.
The central hub manages the network, and data traffic flows between
the hub and individual remote terminals.
5. Frequency Bands:
 VSAT systems operate in various frequency bands, including Ku-band,
C-band, and Ka-band. The choice of frequency band depends on
factors such as the required data rates, geographic location, and
atmospheric conditions.

CODEC:-
Codec, short for "coder-decoder" or "compression-decompression," is a technology
used to compress and decompress digital media files. It is a software or hardwarebased
algorithm that encodes data for transmission or storage and decodes it for
playback or processing. Codecs play a crucial role in multimedia applications by
reducing the size of digital files, making them more efficient for storage,
transmission, and streaming. Here's an explanation of codecs and their key functions:
KEY FUNCTIONS OF CODECS:
1. Compression:
 Codecs employ compression algorithms to reduce the size of digital media
files. Compression is essential for efficient storage and transmission,
particularly in scenarios where bandwidth or storage capacity is limited.
2. Transmission and Streaming:
 Compressed files are easier and faster to transmit over networks. In streaming
applications, codecs facilitate the real-time delivery of audio and video
content by compressing data on the server side and decompressing it on the
client side.
3. Playback and Decoding:
 Codecs are responsible for decoding compressed files during playback. When
you open a multimedia file, the codec decompresses the data, allowing it to
be rendered and played by the media player or application.
4. Quality Preservation:
 Advanced codecs aim to achieve high compression ratios while preserving as
much of the original audio and video quality as possible. This is crucial for
maintaining a satisfactory user experience in multimedia applications.
5. Lossy vs. Lossless Compression:
 Codecs can be categorized as lossy or lossless, depending on the
compression method used. Lossy codecs sacrifice some data during
compression, resulting in a smaller file size but a slight loss of quality. Lossless
codecs, on the other hand, retain all the original data, leading to larger file
sizes.
6. Real-Time Communication:
 In applications such as video conferencing and VoIP (Voice over Internet
Protocol), codecs enable real-time communication by compressing and
decompressing audio and video streams on-the-fly.
7. Container Formats:
 Codecs are often associated with specific container formats (e.g., MP4, AVI,
MKV), which encapsulate audio, video, and other metadata. Container formats
may use different codecs for audio and video streams within the same file.
TYPES OF CODECS:
1. Audio Codecs:
 Examples include MP3, AAC, WMA, and FLAC. These codecs are designed to
compress and decompress audio data.

GSM:-
GSM, which stands for Global System for Mobile Communications, is a standard
developed to facilitate the communication and connection of mobile devices using
digital cellular networks. It is one of the most widely used mobile communication
technologies globally. GSM was initially developed in the 1980s, and it has since
evolved to become the foundation for 2G (second-generation) mobile networks.
KEY COMPONENTS AND FEATURES OF GSM:
1. Digital Cellular Technology:
 GSM represents a shift from analog to digital cellular technology. It employs
digital modulation techniques to encode voice and data signals, providing
better call quality and more efficient use of the radio spectrum.
2. Frequency Bands:
 GSM operates in various frequency bands, including the 900 MHz and 1800
MHz bands. The specific frequency bands used depend on the region and
regulatory considerations.
3. Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA):
 GSM uses TDMA technology, which divides the available frequency into time
slots. Each conversation or data transmission is assigned a specific time slot,
allowing multiple users to share the same frequency channel.
4. Frequency Hopping:
 GSM employs frequency hopping to enhance security and reduce
interference. The communication frequency changes rapidly during a call,
making it more difficult for unauthorized users to eavesdrop or interfere with
the signal.
5. SIM Cards (Subscriber Identity Module):
 One of the distinctive features of GSM is the use of SIM cards. A SIM card is a
small, removable card that contains subscriber information, including the
user's phone number and security keys. It allows users to easily switch devices
while keeping their phone number and personal information.
In summary, GSM revolutionized mobile communication by
introducing digital technology, standardized protocols, and global
interoperability. It paved the way for subsequent generations of
mobile networks, contributing to the evolution of mobile technology
and the widespread adoption of mobile devices and services
worldwide.
SCADA:-
SCADA, which stands for Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition, is a system of
hardware and software components designed to monitor, control, and manage
industrial processes and critical infrastructure. SCADA systems are widely used in
various industries such as energy, water and wastewater, manufacturing,
transportation, and telecommunications to gather and analyze real-time data and
control industrial processes. Here's an overview of key components and
functionalities of SCADA systems:
KEY COMPONENTS OF SCADA SYSTEMS:
1. Supervisory Computers (SCADA Servers):
 The central supervisory computers form the core of the SCADA system. These
servers are responsible for collecting and processing data from field devices,
running applications, and providing a user interface for operators.
2. Human-Machine Interface (HMI):
 The HMI is the user interface through which operators interact with the
SCADA system. It includes graphical displays, alarms, and controls that allow
operators to monitor processes and make decisions.
3. Remote Terminal Units (RTUs) or Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs):
 RTUs or PLCs are field devices that interface directly with sensors, actuators,
and other equipment in the industrial process. They collect real-time data
from the field and send it to the SCADA system for analysis and control.
4. Communication Infrastructure:
 SCADA systems rely on communication networks to transmit data between
the supervisory computers and field devices. Communication protocols such
as Modbus, DNP3, and OPC are commonly used in SCADA networks.
5. Data Acquisition:
 SCADA systems acquire data from various sensors, meters, and instruments
distributed throughout the industrial process. This data includes parameters
such as temperature, pressure, flow rates, and other relevant measurements.
KEY FUNCTIONALITIES OF SCADA SYSTEMS:
1. Real-Time Monitoring:
 SCADA systems continuously monitor industrial processes in real time,
providing operators with a comprehensive view of the system's status and
performance.
2. Process Control:
 SCADA allows operators to control industrial processes remotely. This
includes adjusting setpoints, initiating or stopping processes, and responding
to alarms.
3. Data Visualization:
 The HMI provides graphical representations of the industrial process, making
it easier for operators to understand and analyze complex data.
